# CVE-2024-38812-POC-5-Hands-Private
CVE-2024-38812 : Critical Heap-Buffer Overflow vulnerability in VMWare vCenter.
**Description**
The vCenter Server contains a heap-overflow vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network packet potentially leading to remote code execution.
**CVE-2024-38812:**
Vulnerability Description:

CVE-2024-38812 is a remote code execution vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or commands through specially crafted packets. It is caused by improper input validation, enabling unauthorized actions on the affected system.
This vulnerability allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to exploit the system via specially crafted network requests, leading to potential system compromise or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Issue:
Insufficient input validation or access control flaw in the affected software.
Impact: Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.
Severity: High (potential for remote exploitation).
Mitigation: Update the software to the latest version and monitor for suspicious activity.
Affected Systems:** Details may vary based on the specific software impacted.

**Exploit Instructions for CVE-2024-38812**
This is a privately developed exploit for CVE-2024-38812, allowing remote code execution on vulnerable systems through specially crafted packets. 

**Requirements**
Python: Version 3.9 or higher.
Dependencies: Install the required packages:

pip install requests

**Exploit Instructions**
Prepare the Target: Ensure the target system is running a vulnerable version of the software (refer to the "Affected Versions" section).
Clone the Exploit: Clone the exploit from your private repository or have access to exploit.py.
Run the Exploit: Use the following command to execute arbitrary commands on the target system:

python exploit.py -h <target_ip> -p <target_port> -c '<command>'

Example:

python exploit.py -h 192.168.1.10 -p 8080 -c 'uname -a'

**Optional Flags**
-t for custom timeout (default is 10 seconds).
-r for retry attempts if initial exploitation fails.

**Example Command Execution**

python exploit.py -h 10.0.0.5 -p 443 -c 'whoami'

**Post-Exploitation**
Once successfully executed, the command output will be displayed. You can chain commands to achieve further privilege escalation or data extraction.
